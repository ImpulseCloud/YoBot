# YoStalkBot

A very simple Starcraft 2 AI Bot, forked from yannTM's YoBot, based itself on CryptBot.

It does a dirty 3 gate rush with zealots and stalkers.


Based on files of CryptBot ladder example, see https://github.com/Cryptyc/CryptBot

This bot is meant to compete in the sc2ai ladder competition : https://www.sc2ai.net/
YoStalkBot is middling on the ladder, around 1250 ELO currently. Easily stopped by ranged-units with kiting.

This Bot Code is placed under Gnu General Public License v3, see LICENSE file.
This means you can reuse code from it only if you are using a compatible (FOSS) license.

In particular, any bot submitted to ladder or competitions using code from YoBot is an executable binary that meets the conditions of GPL, and thus falls under the contaminating clause of open source, and must have a public hosting for its sources.

With this condition met, feel free to reuse and adapt the code for your own use, and meet me on Ladder !

We are very open to contributors, ideas etc... please use the issues or discord channel @ sc2ai.
